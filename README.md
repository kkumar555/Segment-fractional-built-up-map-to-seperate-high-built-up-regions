If you are interested on collaborating to do something interesting with this type of analysis...send me an email.

About this script: This script select the high built-up region from the exisiting fractional built map and make it into multiple segments. The segmentation is based on the neighbourhood characteristics extracted from the image. You may need to modify this code according to your requiremnts. This is just a sample code to illustrate the usefulness of fractional built-up map.
